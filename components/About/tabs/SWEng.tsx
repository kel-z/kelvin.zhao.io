      <p>
        First and foremost, Iâ€™m a developer at heart. My endless cycle of
        creating and breaking code started when I picked up Lua at the age of 8,
        where I was introduced to the endless possibilities of what simple lines
        on a screen can accomplish when combined with a little imagination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, I've taken pride in developing apps and services that
        positively impact the people who use it. I'm particularly interested in
        back-end development, as I enjoy the challenge of building scalable and
        reliable software for people to use.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unsurprisingly, I decided to make it my career. I am currently pursuing
        a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at UBC.
